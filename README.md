### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data and Swift: Relationships and More Fetching

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the previous article, we learned about NSManagedObject and how easy it is to create, read, update, and delete records using Core Data. However, I didn't mention relationships in that discussion. Aside from a few caveats you need to be aware of, relationships are just as easy to manipulate as attributes. In this article, we will focus on relationships and we'll also continue our exploration of NSFetchRequest.
